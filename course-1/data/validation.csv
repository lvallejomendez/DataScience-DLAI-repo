__label__1 "i really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $ 88.00 i sent it back . if it had n't been for that it 's a comfy and cute casual top"
__label__0 "i ordered this after seeing the rave reviews . it is not for me . just like the culottes i ordered this romper makes me feel like a grandma . i said i 'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again this was not for me . i also did n't like the back of the romper . no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it 's so low cut . the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric . tts also . i 'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this ."
__label__0 "this silk skirt was not the best look for me but may work for others . i purchased the med which fit fine . i just was n't in love with the print/colors . the skirt has quality material and is well made . it 's very light and airy . i did return it ."
__label__1 "i have an athletic body 5 ' 6 . i have no curves and this dress made me look so feminine and long and lean . on top of it being beautiful the dress has a very comfortable jersey knit type lining . so easy to wear and incredibly comfortable sitting and /or dancing ."
__label__1 "i ordered : xsp xxs xxsp xxsp was the better fit some people loved it some did n't like as much ( thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing . but that being said ti was comfortable the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans . i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me ( like sticky white ) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m"
__label__1 "these cords are a great skinny fit . they seem true to size for me and look great on . only issue i would have is the color says navy but they are more of a deep purple-ish color . i had to recheck my order because they definitely are n't navy .... but i 'm keeping them because the fit is awesome ."
__label__0 "i really like the color of this and the feel but that is where it ends . it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves . i could purchase the belt with it but i do n't prefer to purchase products that can not stand on their own ."
__label__0 "i love maeve dresses but there are several issues with this one ( for my taste ) . 1 ) the fabric and color closely resembles my medical scrubs 2 ) the zipper is cheap and barely goes up or down even when it 's just on the hanger . 3 ) the bow is really cute but does n't make up for the other shortcomings ."
__label__0 "this top would be great if it were longer and the neck was n't so open . even for a boatneck the neck was too wide . for those that do n't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay . the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me ."
__label__1 "the sleeves are small . should buy a larger size than usual . other than this is perfect ."
__label__-1 "did not work for me . material was a bit thin poor quality the tie does n't quite work correctly . had a cheaper look to it . not the quality i 'd normally expect . this is going back ."
__label__-1 "i keep trying to find a peplum that works for me but so far i have been unsuccessful . i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together ? aside from the peplum issue this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large . the material alone is thick making it a bulkier shirt then add the volume of the peplum and i looked ( and felt ) huge . needless to say this one was returned sale or no sale ."
__label__1 "i agree with the previous review i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store ( which is 2 hrs from my house ! ) . the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy . the caveat it is quite short . i am 5'10 135 lbs . i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed ."
__label__1 "a must have 1 piece . every time i wear this i get compliments ! it 's very flattering amazing quality soft material good support and vibrant colors ! i wish this came in more colors and patterns . worth the money no questions asked !"
__label__1 "absolutely adore this jacket . i 'm typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect . the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be . so perfect and beautiful the embroidery is gorgeous i feel so feminine in this coat"
__label__1 "as all the reviews say it is completely sheer . it 's a very cute top other than that ."
__label__-1 "this dress was very boxy and unflattering . i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back ."
__label__0 "i wanted to like this top as i usually adore a cute peplum feature . when i tried it on yesterday in the store i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it . i am petite ( 5 ' 2 110 lbs ) and i tried my usual xs . the fabric was substantial and of a high quality but unfortunately in this design that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me . it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt ! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing ."
__label__0 "i love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color . my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband . not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants . retailer -- please color test your garments . there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age !"
__label__1 "it is one of my favorites from retailer . i received so many compliments while wearing it ! i usually wear a 6 but i sized down to a 4 and still had plenty of room ."
__label__1 "the photo does n't do it justice . the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans . texture is light and gauze-y but i do n't find it too see-though . sizing was tough- i 'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s and went with the xs on this ( ordered both to try ) sacrificing some length for a more flattering width . great for the sale price ! ! !"
__label__1 "i love love these wide leg pants ! the embroidery detail give them a little something extra special . they are comfortable and perfect . the length is great for wedges and the fold over waist does not add bulk . the only downside and this is probably due to my figure but the pockets do need to be sewn shut so that they will lie flat ."
__label__1 "i had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created . the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely . perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady . i have no idea what i 'm going to do when the time comes to wash it though ... we 'll cross that road when we come to it i guess . also - the interior seams are a bright electric blue -"
__label__-1 "regretfully this dress is on its way back for an exchange . the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size i ordered it in both colors however the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom . again the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching pulls or tears for an exchange but i ca n't pay 130 for a dress that is already torn ."
__label__-1 "three strikes and retailer is out for me ! i am so disappointed . i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun distinctive new shift dress . got it tried it on took it off went back to look at the listing online ... nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders . i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image but it 's not mentioned in the text . who on god 's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder ? ! it hits every woman under 5'10 right in the middl"
__label__-1 "this shirt runs very large . i will be returning for a smaller size ."
__label__0 "this immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern and the fabric is actually quite nice . the fit is at least a size or two too large though with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down . my normal 4 was big everywhere and the 2 was still big in the chest but fit everywhere else . the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas but the top section just did n't work for me . maybe better for someone better endowed ?"
__label__-1 "i had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric ... it 's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse . will be returning it ."
__label__0 "this dress is n't as fitted as it looks on the model . it appear to be more of a shift dress . as gorgeous as the print and quality are it does n't look great on me . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 105lbs and bought xs . for whatever reason the high neckline is n't flattering on me . i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders ."
__label__-1 "fits very strange . odd cut . does not look well on ."
__label__-1 "i love almost all tops from retailer however this one was just enormous . it is beautifully designed but it was so huge when i tried it on that i could n't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt . for reference i am 5 ' 2 and 110lbs . i would have loved this shirt if it had n't been so big ."
__label__-1 "the colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess . it was overall too large the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly . had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining i would have liked it better . the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out . # returned"
__label__-1 "the quality and fabric are fabulous but it 's just too voluminous for my figure ( 5 ' 8 155 lbs ) would look great on someone more slender ."
__label__-1 "i love this tank it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws . it rolls up every time i walk or do anything it becomes very bothersome ."
__label__0 "just received pants and even though they are labeled petite they are not . the inseam is 28 for a waist size 26 which is not what the description states ."
__label__-1 "these would have been the perfect black pants ! great cut love the wide band in the front true to size quality construction . but a zipper in the back ? ! ! ! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up . perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on . sending them back since i do n't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this dress in a size 8 my normal size at retailer . it is a lovely dress and so feminine but it is incorrectly sized . i could n't begin to button it . i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything . buyer beware . unless you are itsy bitsy you need to size up . i will say that as pretty as the photos are the dress is even more lovely in person ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to try these on at my local retailer . i 'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off . the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward . they were also not as soft as i expected them to be ."
__label__1 "the shirt is a little roomy but so flattering . the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes with the other positive reviews but it did n't work on me . nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and did n't lay well and did n't do my bust any favors . maybe better on those less pear shaped . hopeless on me ."
__label__1 "this top is so soft and comfortable . i bought it on sale so would i have paid $ 60 for it . . . . not sure . fits true to size what can i say its a simple top well made and so soft ."
__label__0 "not flattering if your have large top . made well and very cute for thin no boob person"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to try this on in the store because i 've had my eye on it online . unfortunately it is not like the picture . the material is very thin almost translucent . i also could not figure out how it get it on ! the cape has short sleeves not long as it appears in the picture and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front . love the look of black design on white . hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall but for now i 'll skip this one ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 6 and it hits me at mid-thigh . the top ( black/camel version ) is sheer enough to need a cami . the waist is quite high . not flattering for me -- the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant -- plus i do n't want to deal with having to wear a cami ."
__label__0 "love the top . love the color . love the back detail . as a larger chested woman the shape was lost a bit . but i just could n't resist ."
__label__0 "this blouse is very pretty but it does gap at the top button . darn ! such a hassle to have to return it or exchange it . but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit ."
__label__0 "i thought this was a sweet design but it is too boxy for me ."
__label__1 "this is a really great top . it is really soft and made very well . it could be a casual top with jeans or dress up with some chunky jewelry and cute heels . i was n't sure which size to get because i mostly get mediums amd i sometimes get a large . i ended up going with a large and it seemed to be just a little too big but it does n't have that look at all . it looks so much better in person than on the computer . overall a very cute top !"
__label__0 "i bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is . this is a warm and cozy sweater more bulky than oversized . pattern has a comic book-style art look . it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist . cute warm sweater for winter -- wore with an undershirt ."
__label__0 "wanted to love this one so badly but did n't work for me . just looks really wide on me -- looks amazing on the model though !"
__label__0 "i was very excited to get this dress in the mail . i was n't sure about the sizing because there were n't any reviews written yet . i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine but there was just so much fabric below the bust . i love that it 's different but i think you 'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you . it does not flatter your body at all ."
__label__-1 "oh elevenses i love your pants .. the fabrics the details the length . i 've found elevenses to be classic work pants . reliable professional well made . these are none of those things . the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that 's it appears in the picture . the red pair are thin stretchy and cheap . both pairs have to go back . i 'm truly sad ."
__label__1 "fits great comfortable !"
__label__1 "love this t-shirt . the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer . it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps ."
__label__1 "i 'm glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down . for reference i am 5 ' 7 and generally a size 8 or m in dresses . the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way but a medium would have swallowed me . otherwise it 's a great casual piece . the material is light and soft and it 's cute over leggings ."
__label__1 "i purchased the bright red color of this bandeau top . the color is vibrant and the overall style is very cute . unfortunately it made my chest look too big ... but the quality is really nice and i 'm sure it would look gorgeous on other body types ."
__label__-1 "ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight . the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight . the medium was large on me . the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges . sadly this coat will be returned ."
__label__1 "comfy but constantly picking pills off of it from first wear ."
__label__0 "beautiful top i love the peplum . the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace . i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "these are light and airy and pretty . they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed . they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them ... or turn over in bed in them . when i sit the slits fall down around my thighs . my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way"
__label__1 "i hated to send this dress back but my busty and curvy figure looked bigger and rounder in this dress . sent it back . it is meant for taller and more slender women ."
__label__0 "love the colors in this top . it 's a shame it was so big and baggy i 'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5 ' 6 130 # . athlete . size small was way too much material for my frame"
__label__0 "this cardigan is very soft and feminine . it looks nice on but it sheds everywhere . i decided to pass on it when it got white fur all over the other clothes in the fitting room . if you do n't mind the shedding then i would recommend this sweater ."
__label__1 "i grabbed this on a lark because it look like a fun little throw on dress . it 's a very lightweight sweatshirt material and fun and a fun flouncy design . run a bit large and regular sizing was still above my knees . if i were 30 years younger i may have bought it just for lounging but the over sized ruffly sleeves made me feel just a bit too silly and the color is pretty washed out . not for me but cute for teens and early 20 's ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to receive this dress . i got a petite 4 as i am 5 ' 2 . it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible . it did n't look good on me . the waist line was a bit too high ... maybe a regular would have looked better . also i thought it was a cotton dress but it is n't . also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance . i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just did n't work for me and i had to send it back ."
__label__-1 "i ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite one 00. the style color and cut are all perfect . one not so minor downfall however . the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot both during the first time just trying them on . i ca n't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed . very sad about this ."
__label__-1 "too wide ! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape . you ca n't see your figure underneath at all . i do n't like pieces like that . this went back ."
__label__1 "i find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small . i 'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect . great sleeve length . just the right amount of v neck . beautiful pattern with a vintage feel . i love the combo of stripes polka dots and sweet flowers ."

__label__-1 "but it just does n't measure up . first the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head . and once on the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky . unfortunately i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately . the material is really cute but the dress is n't worth the price / effort ."

__label__0 "loved the look of this top . sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not . the item ran out of stock far too quickly . i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock . the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest . length is great for taller women ."

__label__0 "so this is a gorgeous dress but it seems to have too many elements . i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more girly than sleek . i am short so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me ."

__label__-1 "the dress is extremely high quality ! i purchased the dress in black . the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress . the dress overall is like a balloon . unless you 're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger ! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5 ' 4 . i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it 's going back : ( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference ."
__label__-1 "i 'm so upset that this did n't work out . i 'm petite at 5 ' 2 and ordered this skirt in petite however i felt like it swallowed me up . the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire . i 'm the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing but on me i feel like a schoolmarm . sadly this is going back ."

__label__1 "my husband rarely seems this pleased and he always likes to see what i try on . oohs and aaaahs galore with this one ! let 's let him review this one .... he says he loves the vibrant color length and the way the top is perfectly fitted . he was impressed with the lining and the mesh at the hem that keeps the 'flare ' in the skirt ( i had to explain that one ) ! he likes the way it looks with a sweater and without and said that i could use more than one of the many pairs of shoes with it that he sees"
__label__0 "not for petite women you need to have a long figure for this tunic to drape like it does on the model . if it ever goes on sale i will purchase it but not worth the full price for me at the moment ."
__label__-1 "this top looked so cute in the picture but unfortunately does n't live up to it ! the one i received actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt . it makes it much darker and boring . the shirt itself is on the short side and would 've looked better if it hit lower on the hips there 's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that ."
__label__0 "beautiful detail soft drapey fabric . but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso . i 'm 5 ' 7 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length ."
__label__1 "i agree with the other reviews ! perfect color and weight to the dress . should wear well in summer and fall . i 'm 5 ' 5 '' 34c 140lbs athletic and got the 6 regular . fit well and the length was perfect with flats ."
__label__-1 "this dress is beautiful and extremely well made ... if you can get into it . the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back . it 's form fitting so you 'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand . i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper but it 's soooo form fitting i 'm afraid i would n't wear it ."
__label__-1 "i loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i could n't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me . i 'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8 and both shirts had the same problem . it was n't exactly the sleeve that was too tight but the arm hole that was not big enough . it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of . which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine . i d"
__label__1 "i bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe . it is really cute and a flattering cut . i just had a baby so it 's perfect for showing some curves without clinging . if anything i 'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected but is still very flattering . i think i 'm still getting used to my new bustline ; ) soft comfy fabric . not too hot . i get compliments when i wear it !"
__label__1 "love this shirt very flattering fit on my pear shape . also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons . ever so slightly sheer fabric but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra ."
__label__0 "i liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple ; however i feel that it was overpriced for the quality . it 's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale ."

__label__-1 "not a pretty blouse - it 's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous ."
__label__0 "i wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return even on sale price : ( agree with previous reviews : bodice too tight neckline too high/chokes fabric is rough outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas . too bad ... so sad !"
__label__1 "this is ruching done right ! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well . it is fitted but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places . it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything . so unless this particular color is your nemesis this dress is a winner !"
__label__0 "this top is for someone flat chested and skinny . i really like the styling color fabric and everything except that it 's not for my body type . i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach ... so it makes me look fat from the sides . the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides ! will be returning it ."
__label__0 "i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly . i am anywhere from a size 6-8 . 5 ' 9 155lbs . sadly i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge ."
__label__1 "oh look i have a booty and would look at that -- i have a waist too ! yes this dress is way casual for its price point ( soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color ) but it 's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove . i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body . wish there were more colors available i would pick them up in a heartbeat . i purchased the medium petite . my stats for fit reference : 5 ' 3 tall 140 # 36dd 28 waist 35 hips wide"
__label__0 "first i absolutely love cloth & stone . but lately i 'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just does n't fit my style . that 's ok because they still have some good basics . what i mean is the cut . a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front ( ie their slip dress they have out right now ) . this particular tank is like that although this one is borderline . the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i ca n't help but think i 'm wearin"
__label__0 "definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt . just too large ; too much fabric for me . i 'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod . i would n't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top . i think the colors are also a bit duller in person . love the concept though !"
__label__0 "i am tall and typically wear a size 10/12 so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted . but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic . it fits like a poncho . with my arms at my sides it fit me similar to the model picture . but if i lift my arms ( to use them ) then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me . the reason for that is that it does n't really have sleeves - it 's more like hol"
__label__0 "i love this ! ! ! ! nice and lightweight . super stylish"
__label__-1 "ugh i hate that this did n't work ! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is ( the sides go way up on me ) . the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes !"
__label__-1 "yikes . there is a whole lot of skirt here . i am 54 weigh around 120 lb and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing depending on the designer . this skirt balloons out from the waist . on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist . i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking . the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf . there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect . definitely returning ."
__label__1 "it is a perfect weight and length . it 's a great dress . i did need to have the waist altered bc it is a straight fit ."
__label__1 "this jacket has great style is really comfortable and looks good with jeans or nice pants . i usually wear a small or extra small in all clothes but thought the arms were tight in the small . the medium is a better fit ."
__label__1 "since there is n't one where i live i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up . saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on . had to get a m as they were out of s and yes it 's a tad large on me but still glad i got it . i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas . love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee . the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch ."
__label__1 "the material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design . it looks very elegant and romantic . you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though because of the design of the straps . it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering . the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath . overall very pretty and i would highly recommend . ( i purchased the white and yellow version . )"
__label__-1 "was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with . for the price of the dress it felt very cheap . i did n't even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging . the colors were not as vibrant as the picture . as another reviewer mentioned it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk . very disappointed and will be returning ."
__label__1 "this precious skirt is a treasure chest of soft bronze fabric circles scattered like coins at the bottom of a fountain . the circles are a bronze color and can not be felt through the skirt net . it 's finely finished and simply a nice piece for dinner out or a day in the office . i received many compliments on my first wearing ."
__label__1 "these jeans fit so well and are made of really high quality denim . soft and comfortable but not too much stretch ... just enough . i 'm short so i have to cuff them . i kinda wish they came in petite or ankle length but they look cute cuffed too ."
__label__1 "this product i better than the pic . nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it"
__label__-1 "dress just did not fit will around the hips . also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off . looks like someone may have wore it and returned it . was not flattering at all ."
__label__0 "the colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it was n't cut for my body shape . i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up & down to have it lay flat ( as in the model ) . ordered size 6 : 34b 150 5 ' 9 tall/slim build . i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress is n't well indicated in the pictures ; i 'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric ."
__label__-1 "was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge . the material is not soft so it does n't fall well . it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant ! !"
__label__1 "this sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall . wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters . love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho . true to size great color . lot 's of compliments ."
__label__-1 "this was so unflattering . the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs . the green was a beautiful vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful top however it looks better on the 80 pound model . the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body . if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are ."
__label__1 "i had been on a white jeans hunt for some time . pilcro is one of my favorite brands and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit . if petite had been available that would have been better in length but it was not so i had them hemmed ."
__label__1 "i love these pants ! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work ! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional ! these are also nice and long for wearing heels . i ordered a size 27 and they fit great . i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing ."
__label__1 "saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning . i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top . it was not tight in the arms ( do n't have super skinny arms ) and the fabric flows nicely ( not too much ) . the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit !"
__label__0 "the picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors . when it came it was more black with some orange that popped . much different then i expected . the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only . i sent it back ."
__label__-1 "beautiful print however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer much sheerer than the product shot shows . i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami however my nude bra was completely visible . the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans so much shorter than the tunic length shown and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person ( the top half of the sleeves are slim and the bottom half are looser ) . over"
__label__0 "i should have exchanged it for a smaller size but i wanted to wear it so my mistake . i tend to wear size 12-14 and the large is entirely too big . it also had piling right out of the bag . but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway . if you get this size down for sure ."
__label__1 "the fit and style of this dress are beautiful . it 's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable . i really wanted to love it but the color just did n't work for me . the pictures make it look like it 's a nice cream color but it 's very tan and i ca n't pull it off with my coloring ."
__label__-1 "i ordered two sizes . when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin . both shirts were in the bag . the style is just okay . the shirt is extremely light weight . i was not impressed with the fabric . i am returning both . definitely did not think it was worth the price ."
__label__0 "i ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small . i found it to be very large . i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy ."
__label__1 "the petite was a little bit long on me ( i 'm 5 ' 2 ) but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable breezy . covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside . a keeper !"
__label__-1 "the pants are pretty and run true to size but the fabric is bathing suit like very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat . i would n't recommend for anything but waking ."
__label__0 "after reading the reviews i decided to give this a try but it just did n't work on me . i 'm 5 ' 8 smaller on top and usually wear m in retailer sizes . this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips . also the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear . not exactly the look i was going for . back it goes ."
__label__1 "this dress makes me looks curvy thin and sexy ! i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style . this one was a winner . i bought 2 others but this one was my favorite . i 'm 5 ' 5 130 ( 32dd ) sz4 fit perfect . the picture on-line does not do it justice - you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself . it looks like an average dress on the model - if you have curves you 'll love this dress !"
__label__-1 "this top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering . i would not recommend ."
__label__-1 "this dress is beautifully made but it does not flair slightly as in the photo it stick out like a tent . it might be a good maternity dress . the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture ."
__label__0 "but-the problem is i can not get the color to stay below the shoulders . the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that did n't lay right . if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me . i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves but i ca n't get the desired look to work out so this is going back ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy . it did not look flattering and will be going back ."
__label__1 "perfect shirt for a low-key day at the office . bought in the umbrella/rain ( white ) print . maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but that 's what i love about them . material is nice recommend hand wash !"
__label__1 "this dress is even more gorgeous in person ! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store . i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years . i think i have finally found the one ' ! i should note i am 5 ' 9 and this dress goes all the way to my knees . it may swallow someone on the shorter side ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however the fit was awful ; . the dress was heavy with a funky liner . it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place . it ran true to size but i have a large chest ( 32dd ) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else . sadly dress had to be returned ."
__label__1 "so soft . a casual tunic yet polished and interesting enough for work . darker blue than the photo and the colors are much brighter and prettier in person ."
__label__-1 "i really loved the colors and style of this top . unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me . i 'm 5 ' 9 . some mentioned they did n't like fabric but i thought it was good !"
__label__0 "i typically take a m or a l in retailer tops/sweaters so i ordered one of each as this has been on back-order for forever . the medium was swimming on me - and i have a very athletic frame with huge traps and biceps . i could have easily taken this in a small and still had plenty of length in the sleeves - and i have very long arms . -- -- -- -- - this sweater is thick and heavy . there 's no way here in atlanta it can be worn anytime other than spring and the occasional very very cool summer night ."
__label__-1 "i 'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are . i ordered the petite small and i 'm always a small . these are huge . i felt like i had on a large . i like the thin material and color and i 'm sad that they are so large ."
__label__-1 "i ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug . you need a big chest and small legs and bottom . too bad . it 's very cute ."
__label__-1 "the tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo . one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing . very disappointing . i wish i had found the hole before i try them on . they are definitely going back ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviews - runs small . would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable . waistband does n't stretch all the way around . bummer ."
__label__1 "when i walked into the store this tee instantly caught my eye . it 's light weight not too low cut and longer in the back . great with jeans skirts or shorts ."
__label__1 "this is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion . i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house . it 's a really warm dress too so great for colder weather . probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps . it 's so comfortable and it 's made with high quality material . i 'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it 's a pretty straight cut ."
__label__0 "nice cut but 6 inches too long and no petite sizes available ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 50 and weigh 105 lbs . i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide and big all over . it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model . also not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long . this would work better on a taller person . i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big . the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute ."
__label__-1 "this suit was high quality and a cute design . however it is clearly made for a lean body type ."
__label__1 "i love this tank it is casual and comfortable but has the little scarf attached to it so sweet and styling . i tried on the xs regular and would need petite it was a bit long on me but some people may prefer that . i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looser-fit tank . both colors are nice and neutral good piece to add to a transition wardrobe . ( 115 lbs 30 dd 26.5 in waist )"
__label__1 "i sadly only noticed this top once on sale . i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big i would need the petite so i had to leave it behind ( 115 lbs 30dd ) - but it is adorable can be dressed up and classy casually with jeans or sweetly so many ways ... love the subtle polka dots ... oh well i am sure i will find something similar i love !"
__label__1 "love this dress so much ! i bought the cranberry color first and i loved it so much that i also bought it in black . i think it runs fairly true to size . i am 5 ' 3 and about 110 and the xs petite fit perfectly . i tried the xs and it was pretty large on my frame . i love the fabric and flow of this dress and i love the pockets ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress and after i got it on . as others mentioned it is difficult to get it on . i wish that the bow snapped on and off . as i took the dress off the bow came off itself . unfortunately going to be returning the dress ."
__label__1 "this dress fits pretty much how it looks on the model . the fabric is soft and the stripes are a goldish color . i bought this because of the other reviews and glad i did ! perfect dress for work and going out . the petite hits me mid-thigh like in the photo ."
__label__0 "really wanted to love this top but it was too boxy for me ! really pretty deep wine colors and a great plaid but overall it did not give me any shape and it was returned"
__label__-1 "i am not sure who would look good in this dress . it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone !"
__label__1 "i love this shirt so much i bought it in another color . it looks like it does in the picture loose and flowy ."
__label__-1 "usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes . this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee . it was baggy hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless ."
__label__0 "i tried this dress on in the store today and the armholes were so wide it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front . while the dress seems like it will be really comfy the arm cuts are so unnatural i had to pass . i did try going down in size and petite and neither of those options worked to fix the situation ."
__label__-1 "i finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews and when they went on sale . i 'm leaving this review for women who share my body type . i 'm slim with longer legs and do n't really have curves . i typically do n't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30 '' . for reference i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h . jeans . these jeans have an inseam of 31 '' which i thought would be fine . but for me the cut was n't flattering at all . i typically look for jeans that"
__label__1 "i love this kimono ! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame . you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement !"
__label__-1 "i wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product . label says that you can wash and dry normally . however upon washing the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not . the robe will now not lay flat ; the fabric pulls at the edges and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut . extremely disappointed . for a $ 100 garment i expected much more . i wish i could return this ."
__label__0 "i ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store . i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected . it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner . i would love to see it in a different fabric ! sadly returned it ...."
__label__0 "wow this runs small ! i 'm thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs ? ! ?"
__label__-1 "i was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress . this was not it . completely see through . i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up . but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip . its an odd design . absolutely not worth the price . i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress . returned this piece without looking back"
__label__-1 "seems there was a design defect in this item -- sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt . i have pretty thin arms so it 's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone . too bad because it 's otherwise a very nice top ."
__label__1 "i bought 2 of these in peach and maize . the fabric is yummy and soft as silk the eyelet detail gorgeous and the colors are great however there is too much fabric ! if only a bit less the fabulous swing shape would work . that said i 'm keeping mine if just for the gorgeous fabric and colors . i would even consider buying the third color just to wear around the house if sale was on sale again ."
__label__1 "first of all this jean fits really well but i usually wear a 31 in mother jeans and i had to go up to a 32 in these ( ugh ! ) because they just ran smaller or whatever . i am curvy on the bottom but the 31 's just felt too tight and pulled everywhere . second the color is not quite right in this picture ; it looks more military green . it is not - it is a much brighter military green vs a moss green . that is throwing me a bit . not quite as versatile or neutral to me . meanwhile the styling with the"
__label__-1 "these socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid . i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf . i would not recommend this product . it felt very cheap and not of good quality ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited when i purchased this top ! it was going to be my go to for running around as it looked super cute with leggings and boots ! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas ..... so comfy ! that all changed after one washing ...... it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before ! makes me sad but it is going back !"
__label__0 "beautiful - ordered a s i wear a 2 in most retailer items . hand washed in cold water shrunk inches yes inches ! love maeve clothing this shirt is gorgeous . before hand washing in the sink it was large and flowy . now it barely fits ."
__label__-1 "the design is very flattering and holiday appropriate . but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used . although figure flattering the zipper is so cheap that -- it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress . and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they 're asking for it . maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail"
__label__1 "sleepwear is always hit or miss with me . i am 5 ' 8 and curvy and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and are n't long enough . or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering . however this pair exceeded all my expectations ! first they are just plain pretty . the pattern and colors are lovely . the blue at the ankle is a cute touch . the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all . i also like how the waist is"
__label__0 "i loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store particularly the muted red color . the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me . however part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired . since i purchased during the sale i 'm going to try and mend myself but this may end up having to go back . if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged i would recommend it !"
__label__1 "great quality coat ! very pretty colors and love the sleeves ! i would have given 5 stars but like other reviewers stated this coat does she 'd . best not to wear black . it is a slight swing style coat so it 's not fitted at the waist and hips but very stylish . i found it best to size down . i 'm 5 ' 4 118lb but i 'm large chested ( 32dd ) i usually wear a size 6 coat or blazer so it fits my chest but the six was too big . the size 4 fit great across my chest and still room for a sweater !"
__label__-1 "this top looks beautiful online . when i got it it looks nothing like the pic . it 's wide too much fabric no shape and so unflattering . it 's definitely going back"
__label__0 "this was very tight in the bust in my typical size . it fit more or less everywhere else but the material has no give . so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress this will be a hard dress to wear . the color is really lovely though !"
__label__0 "the dress is adorable and has a very nice fabric and a slip that goes underneath . it was just too big for me even as a swing dress ."
__label__0 "the fabric was a beautiful color but the material and seams were not well put together . the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well . i unfortunately ended up returning ."
__label__0 "it 's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch . color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted ."
__label__-1 "the fabric is too sheer also looks like sleepwear . just not my thing ."
__label__0 "this dress is very cute on . very flouncy . i know it looks like a gingham dress but it 's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern . the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size ( bug or small ) and i am larger on top so i do n't know what would happen with someone with a small chest . i would n't have minded if it did the same thing on the front but it was just the back ."
__label__-1 "i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online . i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered it was comical . so so boxy . literally shaped like a square . it must be pinned back on this model . maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked ... or perhaps for a larger person it may look super cute ! just did n't work on my slim build . : ("
__label__-1 "i just received this dress wadded up in a bag . it is nothing like the colors shown on line . in the picture it appears blue and white . in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink . the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt . will be sending it back and again remind myself why i should n't try to buy a dress on line ."
__label__1 "i do love this shirt but when it arrived it had makeup around the collar apparently from someone else who had tried it on . i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem but it did make for a poor first impression !"
__label__0 "it looks great on the model but not on me . on me it looked more like a sack of potatoes . the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion . it is very thick . i 'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me ."
__label__0 "this runs really large . i love it ! sold out of xs p and xxs p ... go figure : ( size down if you are slim ."
__label__1 "i am super happy with the t-shirt .... it fits true to size and the cut outs are a great detail ! ! i 'm thinking about buying another ! !"
__label__0 "i really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple ! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 ( my typical size ) - the jumpsuit does n't have a waist i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist . most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow . also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it 's the longest zipper i 've ever seen . it 's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any . i will sadl"
__label__0 "i am ever in search of a light white summer top . this is not quite it . there are two distinct layers and each of them is the scratchy starchy type of gauze . it would just roast me in the summer sun -- but i run fairly hot in general ."

__label__1 "super cute and comfortable ! soft fabric drapes nicely . i wear this with an orange skirt white shirts or jeans . i get lots of compliments on this top and get more use out of it than expected ! i 'm so glad i tried it on ! a nice surprise ."
__label__0 "great summer skirt can be dressed up or down . the band top is weird but you do n't have to style it as pictured . i may get the top hemmed down the road . i have a 32 waist and got a size large ."
__label__-1 "my 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5 ' 2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us . i do n't think a size x small would have made a difference . the length is all over the place .im not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture . on the positive side was very soft . it may work as a beach cover -up ."
__label__-1 "lovey top in the photos . however its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger . i 'm 5 ' 3 118lbs 36c . generally wear xs or 2s in retailer tops . ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering . the lace work is so pretty . it has potential but the design does n't work well for some ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks and feels cheap . the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely . the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking . overall a pretty horrible dress . save your money"
__label__1 "i had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale . when i pulled it out of the package i could not believe how soft it was . literally as a cloud . think of the softest fluffiest baby blanket . also the cut is extremely flattering . i am 5 ' 7 135 lb and the medium fit me perfectly flowing but not boxy . love it !"
__label__-1 "this cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer . the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap ."
__label__1 "for once i found a peasant top that was n't a balloon . i 'm 5 ' 1 and curvier on top and the small fit great . the blouse billowed a bit but it did n't make me look like a hot air balloon . the pattern of the blouse a mix of various floral swatches is very pretty . the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall . i ca n't wait to wear it !"
__label__1 "after seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store . the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly . the style of the top is unique and flattering . now that i see even more colors i 'll need to buy more . my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin so i hope it does n't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer !"
__label__0 "i loved this top when i wore it ! it draped beautifully . i always snatch up all of bordeaux t-shirts because of the way they hang . but beware - you must dry this flat . i 've always had no problem washing and drying their t-shirts but this one shrunk up to half it 's size the first time i washed it and is no longer wearable . it does say on tag lay flat to dry and they mean it !"
__label__0 "my review of the pros : 1 ) quality made not see through in any way can wear with small bra straps 2 ) lace gives the top a 'different look really liked it . my review of the cons which made me return the top 1 ) runs huge ! ! ! i am 5 ' 2 36 small c broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl . it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered ' at the armpits ? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs which i never wear in any size top . 2 ) for petite gals ( i am 5 ' 2 ) this a a"
__label__0 "this is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight . however it is an awkward length . i am tall and have a long torso so it 's just not cut right for me and was not flattering ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 7 155lbs and ordered a large . it fit but the arms were awkwardly short . the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right which would be okay . however the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and is n't even finished with any stitching . it 's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and is n't sewn -- it would unravel with washing . it 's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and do n't mind it com"
__label__1 "love this dress ! the color is gorgeous ! what you do n't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress . i received so many compliments when i wore this dress . the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight . you can wear this dress year round . i love these kind of dresses ! retailer knows how to do this right ! love this store !"
__label__0 "the problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem . ."
__label__1 "thank goodness i packed this on a recent trip to adirondacks because it kept me warm in the cool mountain weather . i love gray so i was drawn to this open stitch sweater . it is a boxy bulky look but a great layering piece . most bulk is in front so it can camouflage areas . i wore this over a gray and black flannel plaid shirt . perfect !"
__label__1 "i purchased the blue version in store . it 's a nice royal blue not navy . ( although the it could be worn with navy . ) i thought the fit was flattering . the middle piece ( pleat ? ) is less obvious on the blue than the purple . the tie at the neck can be untied and it is still not too low cut ."
__label__0 "this top is so pretty in the photos but it just did not work out for me . it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird . i felt like it was true to size but made me feel very boxy . i can say it was very well made so maybe i 'm just not the right body type for it . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 and 135lbs . the small fit perfectly but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste . i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect but i 'll sa"
__label__-1 "i ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice . once i tried it on it was way too big in hips . i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides . i returned the dress ."

__label__1 "i have a pair of elevenses very similar to the turquoise and grey pair and i get non-stop compliments on them . they are very flattering and drape beautifully . the fabric is also complete no-fuss and no-fade . this time i went for the red pair and i love them . they really go with the current upscale 70s vibe ; they have the 70s attitude without the poor quality of most vintage 70s clothes ."
__label__0 "i have mixed feelings about htis top it is a nice shape and comfortable fits triue t o size but hte fabric is thin adn sheer . i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale . the 0 fit me perfectly . ( 115 lbs 3-dd chest ) ."
__label__1 "i bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the & quot ; sky & quot ; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue which disappointed me . it is definitely darker than appears in photo . still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal . it drapes like a snake slithering down your body . it comes with attitude ."
__label__0 "i 'm still on the fence with this shirt . i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close . i 'm 5 ' 3"
__label__0 "this dress ( i ordered the ivory ) is stunning . it is fully lined the belt adds a needed accent and the print on the fabric is gorgeous . the fit though is another issue . i typically wear a 2-4 depending on the cut and fabric of dresses and am pretty proportionate with my hips/bust . i ordered a 2 in this dress . it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs . the fabric has absolutely no give - it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful . if you have any type of hip thigh"
__label__0 "this dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip . the side slits come up high almost to the hip . i am 5 ' 1 and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i do n't wear a belt . if i belt it the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress . i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo"
__label__1 "the size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra wo n't show ( and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight ) . it 's a bit pricey for a basic thin tank but it 's a good every day wear all the time staple ."
__label__1 "this dress is perfect and so sweet ! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large . i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size . the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger ( 34dd ) chest because of the well-constructed bodice . length is nice for us tall girls as well ! !"
__label__0 "wore this romper 1x and after washing the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled . if i want to ever wear it again i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed . unacceptable for a $ 200 product . cute design and good fit but questionable quality ."
__label__1 "i received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another ! beware because the color names are confusing . i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the red thinking i 'd get the red colored tee . however the red tee is actually a light orange color . the orange tee is actually a burgundy/red color . i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color because i really do love the quality of this shirt !"
__label__-1 "based on the other reviews i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering . i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it would n't work . i ca n't imagine this would flatter very many people . the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive . very disappointed -- this will be going back for sure ."
__label__1 "this shirt looked so perfect on the model and i was so excited to get it ! when i received it it was so soft and the color was so vibrant . the only thing is it 's too big . it kind of looks like a maternity shirt . it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me but i 'm happy with it other than that . i 'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time ."
__label__-1 "i loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing . it fit really well and was flattering . the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry . the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places . the sleeves are now tight and way too short . the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches . the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open . i 'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is ."

__label__0 "this top is very light and soft for summer . even the lace is soft . it 's not sheer and does n't require layering . true to size . i 'm 5 ' 4 34dd 150 lbs- m fits well . my arms are not tiny and yet the lace were n't tight for me . but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer . it 's good if you are paying the sale price ."
__label__0 "i really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining so it 's a bit see through under the light . also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt . i just think that with this kind of price the skirt should come at least with the lining . otherwise it 's beautiful skirt flowy and very feminine ."
__label__1 "most casual tops are so sloppy now - not this one ! great cut wish there were more color options ."
__label__-1 "i saw this on sale and it looked lovely online . i really wanted to love it when i received it . it looked great but once i tried it on it bunches up in the back . it looks awkward . the lace and small details are pretty but the fit is just off . returned it in the store ."
__label__0 "in the picture it looked to be a structured blazer but when i tired it on ( i got an extra small ) and it was too big ."
__label__0 "it 's a beautiful top but not for the price . very thin material ( not see-through though ) i fear it may easily rip ."
__label__0 "beautiful dress wonderful fabric very well made just runs really small ! so sad i wanted this dress for a special event !"
__label__1 "i saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design . however when i tried it on i personally found a few things that just did n't work for me : ____________ pros : - blue lace is lovely throughout nicely done . - there 's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups . i can only assume it 's to make it easier to get the dress on . it 's a nice little detail although not sure if really"

__label__0 "i likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit . my bra showed . i am about a d cup smallish in other proportions ( 125 5 ' 6 ) and no bra worked with this so that i would n't have to worry about my bra showing . nice fabric and drape . maybe good for someone who does n't need a bra ?"
__label__0 "following the advice of other reviews i ordered a size larger than normal since the reviews said runs small in the bust . the dress ended up being much too big everywhere including the bust . the dress was beautiful and great quality ! sad i ended up with the wrong size ."
__label__1 "i had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store . the medium fit good and looked great . i ca n't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings . i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it ."

__label__0 "i really like the idea behind this top but at least for me the execution was n't quite there . i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace ( when it gaps/you move you can see a lot ) . if you do n't move the front panel is pretty opaque which is good . i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i do n't feel comfortable with the sheerness so i returned it . i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked"

__label__0 "i ordered this in the orange color from online . they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium ( regular ) . i liked it but just not flattering . i am 5 ' 2 and the coat was too big . sleeves were past my hands . i think because i 'm curvy the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small . it was a nice coat just not for me ."
__label__1 "this top is way cuter in real life . it looks a little frumpy on the model but t is very flattering on . the sleeves are split so not a warm top but this will be a nice transitional piece . i am always looking for interesting but classy tops to war to work and this fits the bill ."
__label__1 "i saw this at a store today and am so glad i tried it on . i 'm usually xs in retailer tops but for this shirt i preferred s for a loose fit . the lace detail is elegant and very pretty ."

__label__0 "the dress is great for pear shapes . however i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing . ordered a small ( 5 ' 8 140 # ) and i still think it may be a bit big . the material is very comfortable not too thick or thin . however i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric . see the attached photo ."
__label__0 "relaxed fit soft and comfortable . interesting design but material is extremely thin . if i had purchased this at full price i probably would have returned it . it seems more like a pajama top ..."
__label__0 "tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom . top is perfect . will return the bottoms and try the large ."
__label__1 "this is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric . it seems to fit tts and the cut is very flattering . however - the white is actually ivory . not a big deal unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it . still on the fence about whether to keep it or not ."
__label__0 "very pretty dress . the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me . i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am . would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut"
__label__-1 "i loved these pants and purchased them in three colors . like another reviewer within a few weeks having worn them no more than a couple of times the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes . i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them . so disappointing as i really did love the pants . total waste of money ."

__label__0 "i like what they were going for here and the fabric . but it falls short in that i ca n't wear it to work -- -the back keyhole is massive so i ca n't wear my normal bras and the very wide neck also shows bra straps so unless i want to go with a strapless bra it 's not useful for me . i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that . i 'd go without but that is a no-no where i work . i may try getting a size smaller . i wear a med . and i got a small and mayb"

__label__0 "the color of this top is lovely . however i felt the quality was lacking for the price . the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already . fit was tts for me ."
__label__0 "i had been eyeing this top for weeks . it 's look so beautiful on the model however not great on me . material is fab . the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material ."
__label__1 "this tee is so cute and well constructed . it 's not a fabric that 's going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love . it runs tts and i like that it 's thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra !"
__label__1 "i got these in gray and ultimately returned them only because i already have a similar pair of pants . they fit true to size and the quality is fantastic . i usually do poorly with pants that zip on the side because of my small frame but i had no problem with these at all . i may go after the other colors !"
__label__0 "i love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it but that would ruin the look of the dress . just an inch or so higher would have been much better . as much as i like the design and fit i will be returning this dress ."
__label__0 "i loved this top when i saw it online . i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly it is not the top for me . if you have a large chest then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance . the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly . if i were an a or b this probably would have worked . i should have known to stay away from a pleated top ."
__label__-1 "for those who are wondering this sweater coat is 50 % lambswool and 50 % acrylic . the original version of this coat was 100 % lambswool . 50 % acrylic yet the price remained the same ? ? ? i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in 100 % lambswool like the original version . this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials ."
__label__0 "i purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers . while the cut is fine the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through . will be returning it ."
__label__0 "the sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much . but it 's a cute pattern and style . very comfortable ."
__label__0 "this top has gorgeous embroidery very very nice looks good in both wine and grey . it runs large . i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it . i usually wear xl i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top . i have a big bust and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery . the arms also tend to look wider due to the style . i do n't like the fit at all ."
__label__1 "i could live in this top : it 's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer ; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything ; and it 's comfortable enough to wear around the clock . note that it runs small . i had to size up to a medium even though 80 % of everything else i wear is size small ."
__label__-1 "while the print is cute the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller . the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model ( it rides up under your boobs ) and the whole cup area tips forward - it 's not really molded like a bra more flat foam insert . immediately went back . hopefully if retailer continues to do swimwear they 'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they 're also workable for fuller cup sizes ( underwire please ! )"
__label__0 "i really liked the top once i saw it but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath . the fabric is a little stiff . it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist . the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine but it is a nice top ."
__label__-1 "this simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear but do not wash it . the hem completely fell apart for me !"

__label__1 "love this shirt can dress up or more casual . wish i would of purchased all colors !"
__label__-1 "had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits . however that was not the case . this skirt is not lined and the material is so so . basically for the price i was underwhelmed and will return it ."
__label__1 "this skirt is so cute ! ! highly recommend super easy to dress up or to dress down . it is n't shown as well in the picture but it has really intricate and pretty detailed stitching throughout the skirt . i have gotten so many compliments on it random people have even stopped to tell me how much they like it and where they can find it . it runs a little small so i recommend buying it a size up . also if you 're taller like me it is a little short in the back . overall a great buy !"
__label__-1 "i saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely the perfect work dress . i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out so i visited another retailer and another to find it . unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me it seemed to overly accentuate it . i am 5 ' 9 a 36 dd size 12. the colors the fabric are all wonderful . but this dress is not for me ."
__label__-1 "tried this on at my local retailer the red color is pretty but not a true red . the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days . two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it opening up to the world ! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra this is a deal-breaker for me it ca n't be fixed ."
__label__0 "i sized down one size and it 's still too big with the double v-neck style . this is going back ."
__label__0 "i love a good peplum top and was so excited when it arrived but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much . i 'm not sure why it was so unflattering because in every other way it fit like a dream but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly . it had to go back ."
__label__0 "i was not a fan . cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket . the arms were small and the body was big ... odd combo . the material did n't make me want to put it on . it went back ."
__label__1 "i saw this and had to have it ! it is so beautiful . it has pops of color that can be paired with so many options . i like the uniqueness of the flowers being on the backside . it is thinner fabric so i will have to wear a black cami underneath but i have no problem with that . especially going into cooler weather anyway . it is very flattering on . this one will go fast . thank you retailer !"
__label__0 "i loved the material 's texture and drape but it was too sheer for me . i am 100 % against having to wear a tank under white tees . ( which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees but ... ) other than the see-through nature i loved this shirt !"
__label__-1 "this shirt would be perfect if i needed a canopy on my tent . this shirt runs ridiculously large . purchased a medium and it should be labeled an xl . no impressed with the pattern in person . looks cheap . will be returning ."
__label__-1 "this top is too short so much so that tucking it in would be difficult . the designs are lovely but the short length is putting this top back on the rack ."
__label__-1 "this hoodie was too thin . you can see right through it . i returned it ."
__label__1 "very much in love with this ethereal delicate dress . the silk is very light and slightly clingy so take caution when wearing . the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with . the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite . those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down otherwise tts . for reference i am 5 ' 3 36dd 140 #"
__label__1 "i thought these were pretty on the website but in person they look like a work of art ! the colors are vivid -- bright reds pinks greens blues yellow -- with flora fauna houses writing type and so many other things on a white and cream background . they are very soft medium-weight flannel . for me they run true to size . i wish they had pockets though !"
__label__1 "absolutely love this dress . it is perfect for the summer . yes it wrinkles but that does not take away from how cute the dress is . the style is so unique love the pleats . i am 146lbs 5 ' 6 36dd and the size 8 fits perfectly . not tight through the arms holes or the bust area . the dress hangs perfectly you can dress it up or where it to run errands ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews . i workout and it was snug on my arms .. fabric felt great loved the fringe .. just a but snug in the arms for me ."
__label__1 "love this sweater ! it is so cozy ! i gave it a four because it does shed a lot . i have not washed yet but hopefully that will help with the shedding . i am hoping to buy other colors ."
__label__1 "i have these in grey and i love them ! they are so comfy . i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit . they are very soft ."
__label__1 "i did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt . i really liked both looks . if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return . this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple . my only complaint is why two neutral colors ? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn . the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone ."
__label__-1 "this did n't work for me . the piece looked cheap rode very high ... needed to be longer . the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes . it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece . this went back ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt . it is great quality and hangs perfectly ! please make more colors in this one . i would buy all of them ! !"
__label__-1 "i was really excited to get this top in the mail ; unlike other reviewers i did n't find that the top fit small but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest did n't look good with the billow-y torso of the top . i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls but i 'm very tall and broad shouldered so it did n't look as good on me ."
__label__-1 "the top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me . maybe would 've been better for someone with a smaller bust . the quality of the fabric was just okay ."
__label__-1 "there is no way this is worth the price . i was deeply disappointed when it arrived . the material is thin and feels cheap . i love the design and anna sui but this is just so overpriced ."
__label__1 "these are beautiful and very comfy . they do run very large . i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small . the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results . the description needs to be updated to reflect this ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile . when it arrived the pleat in front ( shown in the center ) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked . not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that 's the true design but it will have to go back . too bad because i had high hopes !"
__label__-1 "i 'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses especially the petite xs maxis . this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made . it was humongous and gave me no shape . even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same . i 'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess -- which also makes no sense because it 's the petite size . do not buy . i 'm very upset i have to pay the $ 5.95 return fee since i ordered this ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in cream during the 25 % sale . i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty but it was not my size so i did n't try it on . when it arrived it was a wrinkled mess . it was so wrinkled that i do n't think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily . i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer . it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular . it was also way too short for me . i 'll be taking it back very soon . i do plan"
__label__-1 "this is a beautiful spring/summer dress and the quality of the materials is great . i wanted to love it . but the sizing is ridiculous ! i 'm 5 ' 3 and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs . while the pictures of the model in the dress do n't suggest it has a shapeless cut it definitely looked like a sack on me . a sack with a lovely print but still an ill-fitting sack ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality . but the shape is impossible to work with . it does n't just run big it just hangs there . really disappointing . it 'll have to go back ."
__label__0 "i 'd hoped these would be cozy and warm . the fabric is thin and slinky . it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll . could n't wait to get them off . just horrible . and that price is very steep . ca n't recommend ."
__label__0 "i ordered my normal size in this dress . i am 6 foot tall but the regular sizes were too large and too long ( mid-calf ) . i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline . the dress is lovely especially on the models in the pictures but did n't quite work out for me . also it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time !"
__label__0 "the styling of this top is really cute . it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look . my biggest complaint is the quality ! it 's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer . it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge it curls really badly . i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time . not worth the $ $ if paying full price ."
__label__1 "i have loved ag stevie ankle denim for awhile now and have never been disappointed with the fit or quality . this pair is no exception to that . i am 5 ' 5 and about 113 slender with athletic thighs and the 26 fit great . buying them on-line i was n't able to check how distressed the denim was . the pair i received in the mail was indeed slightly different in the distressed locations from the on-line image . mine had no distressing on the upper thigh and one medium and one small spot on each leg . onl"

( my boyfriend does n't quite get the 3/4-length sleeves but that definitely keeps the look of this jacket polished -- if they were longer i think it would be too much just li"
__label__0 "i wanted so badly for this dress to work on me . the design is amazing . the detail is so pretty and delicate . its my version of the perfect little black dress ! however i have very big arms ... and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all . i 'm usually a 14-16 in dresses . i tried the 16 and it just did n't work . the arms were way too tight . however i 've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me and they"
__label__1 "these are my favourite sleep pants . the waist band shrinks with every wash even without drying all the way on low . i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large so the waist band did n't cut in my sides ."
__label__0 "this is such a cute design but it 's so short ! it barely hits at my hips . you 'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed . i 'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top . i wish they 'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big it 's not like the buttons need to function . i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great . too bad it 's so short and gapes open at the bust . going back ."
__label__0 "i really liked the fabric and look of this top but i was swimming in fabric . there was so much that the top felt heavy . i returned it ."
__label__-1 "i love good flowy blouses and like the over sized look but this one did n't wow me . i thought the quality was just ok. it did n't flatter me . i almost liked it but i did n't . i 'm glad i tried it on because looking at the pics online i thought i 'd like it way more than i did . just not great ."
__label__0 "ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online . runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric . i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol . i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on . the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though ! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering !"
__label__0 "ugh . i was so excited to get this dress and for 30 % off . this dress is adorable . unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls . otherwise the fit was perfect . very disappointed in the top of this dress ."
__label__-1 "i noticed this top on one of the sales associates and it looked great . she 's probably 230lbs and about 5 ' 5 . tried it on and it looked horrible i even tried sizing down twice . i 'm 5 ' 8 and the ruffles started right under my chest . i gave 2 stars bc of the material it is light and summery ."
__label__1 "these are great wear- anywhere shorts . they are not too long and not too short . they are very soft and comfy . i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps . i will still keep the 6 's for wearing around the house ."
__label__1 "these pants are perfect for crisp fall weather and comfortable ! i wear them with flats to dress down or heels to dress up ! recommended for all shapes !"
__label__0 "i ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large . i am 5 ' 2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5 ' 9 like the model to wear this dress . such a shame .."
__label__0 "this dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front . i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face . all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx . $ 250 was too much to spend on this ."
__label__1 "one of the best maxi dresses i have ever found ! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust ( 36g ) and camouflage my postpartum belly . the dress did it all . i ordered the large ( 5 ' 7 and 155 lbs ) and it is so flattering . it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty . and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer . like i said best maxi dress ever . price is pretty high but it was worth it !"
__label__-1 "this dress overwhelmed me . i 'm 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over ."
__label__1 "this top is very well made . nice heavy material for those in between days . the back is slightly longer than the front and it is well finished inside . i ordered a 00 which fits great in the body area but a little tight on my arms . still a keeper !"
__label__-1 "i 've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i 've ever posted a bad review . first of all the fabric is scratchy thin and looks very cheap . second of all there is no v back it 's more of a slight scoop . and lastly i 'm 5 ' 3 so i ordered the petite small and it 's still comes 4 inches below my knee . i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back . the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup ."
__label__0 "they are beautiful in person until you put the on . the fit was a bit weird ; tighter in the waist roomy in the crotch . the fabrics work 100 % against one another . the vegan leather especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams is too stiff . the back is thin and has far too much elasticity . at $ 150 i passed . these will only enter my closet on sale ."
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted the fit of this tee is very boxy . it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans but otherwise is unflattering . also the color is described as black but mine looks like a navy blue in person . i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult but if able to i would have returned it ."
__label__1 "this blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack .. living in l.a. it 's 90 degrees one day and 60 the next . the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate . it runs true to size and is very comfy . thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner ."
__label__0 "it really is such a cute romper . took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable . that is in till i washed it . i 'm in europe so there are n't dryers ... washed it in cold water line-dried it and it shrunk . significantly . it still fits but the top does n't blouse over like it previously did . and the shorts feel really short . so disappointed . my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water"
__label__-1 "where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go ? ? ? these are a cheap impersonator . the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half . the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i 've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally . the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering . the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially . the old stet ankle jeans ha"
__label__1 "this sweater is so cute and classic and i 've gotten so many compliments it 's so gorgeous the wool is sooo warm 10/10 recommend"
__label__-1 "i loved this dress before putting it on but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type . it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for . sadly this will be going back . i loved the print and the feel of the material . just not a flattering cut for me ."
__label__-1 "ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality ."
__label__0 "was excited for this shirt . i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material so i went with a medium . i was swimming in it . definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal ."
__label__0 "i 'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve . the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve but the sleeves do not fit loosely they kind of twist under the armpit area . i do not have large arms so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves but they do not fit right . i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline . it is messy and tacky looking but i think that is how it was meant to be . my recommendation to buy"
__label__0 "this is a lot shinier in person and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size . there is a hi-lo hem going on that does n't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side . due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band it can get crumply on the side if you do n't get the right size . the material feels a little thin and scratchy ."
__label__0 "this jacket runs very large . i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium . i have long arms and the sleeves were way past my hands . i love the jacket but it 's just too sloppy ."
__label__1 "this tank is soft and flexible . great fit with wonderful material . very pleased ."
__label__1 "love this dress ! ! ! i agree with the other reviewers i had to size up one size but then it was perfect . i 'm 5 ' 5 125 lbs . and the size 6 worked great ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in a small petite and medium petite and i am a huge fan of a * k. i put tried on the sp . while it fit it was very long even for a petite . what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide . even a long necklace would n't help deter the look . on a positive side the blue was a very nice cool color . i am usually a small to medium in a * k ( 6-8 in tops ) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice just too much fabric for me . returning !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this shirt . i like the style the material is soft but it was so short on me . perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else . i was n't even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short ."
__label__1 "this is adorable and unique . i 've tried shawls and ponchos before they usually swallow me up this sweater has that type of feel but is n't so much fabric . goes with everything ."
__label__1 "this cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks . i love the fit of the small ( 5 '' 3 and small/medium build ) . would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home ."
__label__1 "i saw this top online and loved it . i was n't sure about sizing and because i do n't live near a store i decided to order two sizes . i 'm 5 ' 8 and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops . the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders . i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully !"
__label__1 "this dress i received is stylish comfortable and very nice to wear . i love the length goes just below the knee and i am 5 ' 2 so it is perfect for me . i ca n't say enough about this dress as i ca n't wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know . thank you retailer for this beauty !"
__label__0 "this is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to ... it 's just simply richer and prettier in person . there 's a nice drape to the fabric but it 's cut pretty short and wide which is n't flattering imo unless you are very petite and have a small bust . i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me . i would have given it a higher star rat"
__label__1 "i purchased this top in the store intending only to go in and return two tops i purchased on sale that did not fit . i had been looking for a red top to wear with navy and this one could n't have looked more perfect on the hanger . from the front it looks pretty traditional but the back is just gorgeous ! the multi-colors and the pleating give the top a lot of interest and depth . the fabric is also super soft and comfortable . the top does run quite large though as i purchased an xs and still h"

__label__-1 "i was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses ( my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later ) when i bought this . once i tried this on at home i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there 's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back . i wanted to love t"

__label__-1 "so unflattering ! really disappointed . made me look 6 month pregnant and i 'm a petite size 2 ."
__label__1 "i ordered this as a gift and may order myself one . it is so comfortable and pretty ."
__label__-1 "guess i should 've looked at the pictures more closely . i ordered the white version and in the pictures you ca n't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version . it also would 've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description . anyway i will be returning this top because i do n't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms . looks a bit pirate-like to me ."
__label__-1 "really well made . beautiful . sadly it is very short . not a tunic at all ."
__label__-1 "this top is really cute but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso . i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin ."

__label__-1 "i ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall in order to see which was the best fit . i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have . i was really disappointed the sweater does n't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and is n't flattering . i have a small build and frankly i usually look good in sweaters"
__label__1 "it 's a cozy sweater that does n't make me feel frumpy still stylish and it 's not too heavy but still warm enough . it 's like wearing a blanket sort of . definitely sheer with the big loom wear a camisole under it . i got compliments the first day i wore it !"

__label__0 "i wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes . not worth the price . poorly made . you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin . the shirt looks better int he picture . i like it but it wears terribly ."

__label__-1 "unique print but not great execution . the pant legs are very tight i have average sized calves and i sized up one size . the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp . when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color . too bad this did n't work out ."
__label__-1 "this skirt was horrible on me . it was loose in the waist tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom . the material also felt cheap and clingy . i guess the fit is tts but it 's hard to tell given how strange the cut was ."
__label__0 "the fabric of this dress feels like suede i could n't stop touching it . here comes the but : the dress is cut straight down no definition . the rosette lace is sewn on like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap . i tried it on with a belt and by itself and i still feel like it 's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store . i 'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed . size s regu"

__label__0 "this skirt runs very large -- even in the petite line . there was also no shape to the skirt ( at least as it looked on my body ) . the color was nice ( in the pink-grapeish hue ) but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body ( 00p ) ."

__label__-1 "i am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress . maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered but i still do n't think it would have worked . the fabric is very soft but that 's where it 's qualities for me ended . the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips . ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 and 125 hourglass . 32dd . ) the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it ."

__label__0 "i love love love this absolutely stunning dress . the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver and when it finally went up the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress . i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each . i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much ."

__label__0 "i loved this dress and was hoping to keep it . but for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy . i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips ."
__label__1 "i received many compliments on this top . it 's very cute and versatile . a pair of jeans or a skirt or capris all can work well with this ."
__label__1 "love love these jeans . they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect . the color of the demin is great to wear to work . the fit is great ."
__label__-1 "there 's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views . it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse . the print is lovely but the fit is very odd . it 's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too . i wear medium or large and ordered size large . if you 're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you . but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide . returned ."
__label__0 "nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle . they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant perhaps ."
